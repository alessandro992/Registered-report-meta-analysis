#' 
#' ------------------------------------
#' 
#' **Brief information about the methods used in the analysis:**
#' 
#' **RMA results with model-based SEs**
#' k = number of studies; sqrt in "Variance components" = tau, the standard deviation of true effects; estimate in "Model results" = naive MA estimate
#'
#' **RVE SEs with Satterthwaite small-sample correction**
#' Estimate based on a multilevel RE model with constant sampling correlation model (CHE - correlated hierarchical effects - working model) (Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2020; https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/vyfcj/). 
#' Interpretation of naive-meta-analysis should be based on these estimates.
#'
#' **Prediction interval**
#' Shows the expected range of true effects in similar studies.
#' As an approximation, in 95% of cases the true effect in a new *published* study can be expected to fall between PI LB and PI UB.
#' Note that these are non-adjusted estimates. An unbiased newly conducted study will more likely fall in an interval centered around bias-adjusted estimate with a wider CI width.
#'
#' **Heterogeneity**
#' Tau can be interpreted as the total amount of heterogeneity in the true effects. 
#' I^2$ represents the ratio of true heterogeneity to total variance across the observed effect estimates. Estimates calculated by two approaches are reported.
#' This is followed by separate estimates of between- and within-cluster heterogeneity and estimated intra-class correlation of underlying true effects.
#' 
#' **Proportion of significant results**
#' What proportion of effects were statistically at the alpha level of .05.
#' 
#' **ES-precision correlation**
#' Kendalls's correlation between the ES and precision.
#' 
#' **4/3PSM**
#' Applies a permutation-based, step-function 4-parameter selection model (one-tailed p-value steps = c(.025, .5, 1)). 
#' Falls back to 3-parameter selection model if at least one of the three p-value intervals contains less than 5 p-values.
#' For this meta-analysis, we applied 3-parameter selection model by default as there were only 11 independent effects in the opposite direction overall (6%), causing the estimates to be unstable across iterations.
#' pvalue = p-value testing H0 that the effect is zero. ciLB and ciUB are lower and upper bound of the CI. k = number of studies. steps = 3 means that the 4PSM was applied, 2 means that the 3PSM was applied.
#' We also ran two sensitivity analyses of the selection model, the Vevea & Woods (2005) step function model with a priori defined selection weights and the Robust Bayesian Meta-analysis model employing the model-averaging approach (Barto≈° & Maier, 2020).
#' 
#' **PET-PEESE**
#' Estimated effect size of an infinitely precise study. Using 4/3PSM as the conditional estimator instead of PET (can be changed to PET). If the PET-PEESE estimate is in the opposite direction, the effect can be regarded nil. 
#' By default (can be changed to PET), the function employs a modified sample-size based estimator (see https://www.jepusto.com/pet-peese-performance/). 
#' It also uses the same RVE sandwich-type based estimator in a CHE (correlated hierarchical effects) working model with the identical random effects structure as the primary (naive) meta-analytic model. 
#' 
#' We report results for both, PET and PEESE, with the first reported one being the primary (based on the conditional estimator).
#' 
#' **WAAP-WLS**
#' The combined WAAP-WLS estimator (weighted average of the adequately powered - weighted least squares) tries to identify studies that are adequately powered to detect the meta-analytic effect. 
#' If there is less than two such studies, the method falls back to the WLS estimator (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2015). If there are at least two adequately powered studies, WAAP returns a WLS estimate based on effects from only those studies.
#' 
#' type = 1: WAAP estimate, 2: WLS estimate. kAdequate = number of adequately powered studies
#' 
#' **p-uniform**
#' P-uniform* is a selection model conceptually similar to p-curve. It makes use of the fact that p-values follow a uniform distribution at the true effect size while it includes also nonsignificant effect sizes.
#' Permutation-based version of p-uniform method, the so-called p-uniform* (van Aert, van Assen, 2021).
#' 
#' **p-curve**
#' Permutation-based p-curve method. Output should be self-explanatory. For more info see p-curve.com
#' 
#' **Power for detecting SESOI and bias-corrected parameter estimates**
#' Estimates of the statistical power for detecting a smallest effect sizes of interest equal to .20, .50, and .70 in SD units (Cohen's d). 
#' A sort of a thought experiment, we also assumed that population true values equal the bias-corrected estimates (4/3PSM or PET-PEESE) and computed power for those.
#' 
#' **Handling of dependencies in bias-correction methods**
#' To handle dependencies among the effects, the 4PSM, p-curve, p-uniform are implemented using a permutation-based procedure, randomly selecting only one focal effect (i.e., excluding those which were not coded as being focal) from a single study and iterating nIterations times.
#' Lastly, the procedure selects the result with the median value of the ES estimate (4PSM, p-uniform) or median z-score of the full p-curve (p-curve).

#'# Moderator/sensitivity analyses
#' The below reported meta-regressions are all implemented as a multivariate RVE-based models using the CHE working model (Pustejovsky & Tipton, 2020; https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/vyfcj/).
#' Testing of contrasts is carried out using a robust Wald-type test testing the equality of estimates across levels of the moderator.
